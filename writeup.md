The scan shows us that there are 2 open port port 21 (FTP), and 1337 (Werkzeug HTTPd). Now let's analyze the UDP ports.

The SNMP port was found which works in public, we will analyze this later and the same for the FTP.

# FTP

We can see in the FTP server there is a file named "init.py.bak", download it with the ftp command.

    # ftp 192.168.0.44
    Connected to 192.168.0.44.

This is probably an old backup file, when we open the file it probably looks like the Werkzeug server for port 1337, we will be interested in this for later.
